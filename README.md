## Individual specialisation with mentorship
<br/>

### Objectives of the specialisation

This phase has two main objectives:

1. **Learn how to learn.** The IT sector is characterized, among other things, by being in constant change and evolution. Throughout your professional career, it will be necessary to regularly update your knowledge and learn new things to pivot to other technologies. For this reason, it is of vital importance that you incorporate self-learning into your DNA and increase your resilience.

2. **Master your technology stack.** To apply for junior positions (Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, Data Scientist, etc.), you will need to master a set of programming languages and tools. In this phase, you will learn the minimum essentials to join a development team as a junior member with confidence.

<br/>

### Methodology

**Flipped Classroom.** The mentor will be your reference point and will guide you throughout your autonomous learning, establishing a close and trusting relationship.

**Teaching Role.**

In this phase of specialization, the mentor’s role is fourfold:

1. Solve and help understand all doubts and problems.

2. Correct all practices and exercises.

3. Provide feedback on your progress.

4. Give simple explanations when the group needs them.

In addition to these four tasks, a fifth responsibility is added, which is to give master classes on critical points of each program or other topics with broader horizons related to software development.

**Mentor vs. Teaching Staff**

The mentor will be your trusted person who will guide you throughout your learning process. As you progress through each sprint, the support you receive will change so that you gain autonomy and reduce your dependency. In no case will the mentor provide the answers or solutions to your tasks.

<br/>

### Achievements and Skills

**Achievements:** By the end of the course, you should have the maximum level of autonomy as a software developer.

**Skills:** During the sprints, you will need to learn how to learn, increase your resilience, structure a project in the chosen technology, and defend the technical decisions you make.

<br/>

### Course Organization

During the course, you will use different tools that will allow you to communicate with mentors, technical staff, and other students. They are as follows:

1. **Discord:** This is the IT Academy community platform. You can hold meetings, individual chats, group chats, and video calls. You will also be able to stay updated and engage in discussions in specific channels related to each topic.

2. **Microsoft Teams – Virtual Classroom:** If you are taking the course remotely, the virtual classroom is where you can find your mentor and other classmates online during the scheduled course hours. Here, you can ask questions and listen to explanations from your mentor.

3. **Virtual Campus – Moodle:** This is where you are now. On this platform, you will find all the course content organized, as well as the assignments you need to submit.

4. **GitHub:** This is the reference space for the starter code for the tasks you will encounter throughout your chosen specialization. You will also use your personal GitHub profile to submit your work via pull requests.


<br/>

### Sprint Content

Within each sprint, you will find:

1. **Tasks.** Tasks are the primary element to ensure the acquisition of your technical knowledge.

2. **Task Validation:** In some cases, you may be able to validate your knowledge in certain areas of the course. Inform your mentor about the tasks or sprints that you have already mastered. Once you communicate this, they will guide you through the validation process.

3. **Videos, Tutorials, and Articles:** To help you complete the tasks, we provide resources segmented by themes that will help you acquire the technical knowledge necessary to complete the exercises.

4. **Included Information Sources:** To solve the tasks, we have selected free videos, tutorials, and articles available online. All of them come from recognized sources and address topics you will encounter in the tasks.

It is not necessary to view all the proposed content. Only do so if you are unable to complete the task. If you want to consult other technical resources on the web, books, etc., feel free to do so. In fact, we encourage it!

<br/>

### Task Levels

At the end of each sprint, you must have submitted all the tasks.

Each task is divided into 3 levels: you must submit all exercises by satisfactorily completing at least level 1. It will not be possible to move on to the next sprint without having correctly completed level 1 of each task.

Once you’ve completed level 1, if you still have time within the sprint, you should work on level 2 (and if possible, level 3).

Level 1 is the minimum essential requirement, while levels 2 and 3 expand on the initial knowledge. These levels allow the mentor to assess areas of strength and improvement (both technical and personal) for your development.

Once you’ve submitted an exercise or task, the mentor will correct it with technical comments through the platform. Often, the mentor will ask for improvements on critical aspects of the exercise and may request a new submission.

You should aim to complete all levels of all tasks within the assigned time, thereby assimilating the broadest range of technical knowledge.

### Checkpoints

The course has 3 checkpoints to ensure that you are consolidating your knowledge correctly:

1. Level Test – Interview (Sprint 3).

    During 10 minutes, you will need to verbally answer different technical questions based on the first 3 sprints, demonstrating the level of your knowledge and explaining the reasoning behind your technical decisions.

2. Exercise Defense – (Final Sprint).

    The last exercise of the final sprint (the one with the most technical complexity) includes defending the software.

    The minimum passing grade for this exercise consists of 5 out of 10 points, with 3 points corresponding to the correct functioning and construction of the software, and 2 points for properly defending the reasoning behind the decisions you made. The remaining 5 points will be awarded for completing levels 2 and 3 of the exercise.

3. Final Evaluation Before the Project.

    After the final sprint, you will need to pass a personal evaluation with your mentor before moving on to the final project.

    If you submit all tasks correctly but are unable to explain or reason through how you are programming, we will understand that you are not yet ready to move on to the project. Copying code or asking for help to complete tasks without understanding what you're doing will not help you become a developer.
