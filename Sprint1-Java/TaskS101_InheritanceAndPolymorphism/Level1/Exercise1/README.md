## Exercise 1

<br/>

In a music group, there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind instruments, string instruments, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have as attributes their name and price. Additionally, they have a method called play(). This method is abstract in the Instrument class, and therefore, must be implemented in the child classes. If a wind instrument is being played, the method should display the message: "A wind instrument is playing" in the console; if a string instrument is being played: "A string instrument is playing"; and if a percussion instrument is being played: "A percussion instrument is playing."

The class loading process only occurs once. Demonstrate that the loading can be triggered either by creating the first instance of the class or by accessing a static member of the class.

Look up information about initialization blocks and static blocks in Java.
