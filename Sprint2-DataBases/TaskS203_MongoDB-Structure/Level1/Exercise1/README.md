# Sprint 2: Databases. Data Structure - MongoDB

<br/>

**Desctiption**

We will create different databases in MongoDB.

### Optical Shop:

An optical shop, named “Cul d'Ampolla,” wants to computerize the management of clients and the sales of glasses.

First, the optical shop wants to know who the supplier is for each pair of glasses. Specifically, it wants to know the following details about each supplier:

        Name
        Address (street, number, floor, door, city, postode, and country)
        Phone number
        Fax
        VAT number (NIF)

For glasses, the shop wants to know:

        Brand
        Prescription for each lens
        Type of frame (floating, plastic, or metal)
        Frame color
        Lens color
        Price

For customers, the shop wants to store:

        Name
        Postal address
        Phone number
        Email address
        Registration date

When a new customer arrives, store the name of the client who recommended the establishment (if someone did recommend it).

The system must indicate which employee sold each pair of glasses. It should also define the date and time when the sale was made.

#### Exercise 1

Imagine we have the following graphical interface from the perspective of a client of the optical shop. How would you design the database to facilitate the information?
